This is a program that reads a csv file based on the user inputs. 
Sorts the file and does other functionality 

Few design decisions i made 
1.) The counter to check if the user has entered incorrectly thrice starts from 0 and therefore if counter reaches 3 the program tells the user and exists the program
2.) I have set a constant variable called DEBUG throughout the program i have used print or assert statements which will only work if DEBUG == True
3.) I have changed the name of the csv file to file.csv
4.) User has the option to enter the path of the file manually as an argument in command prompt 
5.) I have choosen -1 as the sentinal value which user can enter anytime to exit the program
